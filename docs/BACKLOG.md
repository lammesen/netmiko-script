## P0 - Critical Priority (Must Do First)

### ARCH-001: Modularize monolithic application into /src structure
**Type**: Refactor | **Effort**: 5 | **Risk**: High | **Dependencies**: TEST-001, RFC-001

Break down the 2,837-line netmiko_collector.py into a modular architecture with separate modules for CLI, config, devices, commands, SSH, executor, formatters, UI, and utils.

**Rationale**: Current monolithic design makes testing, maintenance, and extension difficult. Modular design enables better separation of concerns, easier testing, and improved code reusability.

**Acceptance Criteria**:

**Rationale**: Low test coverage (20%) makes refactoring risky and masks bugs. High coverage enables confident refactoring and reduces regression risk.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Code coverage >80% (from current 20%)
- Tests organized in /tests directory structure
- Fixtures directory created with test data
